First-time AWS User Setup[^1] {#aws_account}
=============================

If you\'ve never used AWS before and don\'t have an account, follow the
instructions below to get started.

Creating an AWS Account
-----------------------

First, you\'ll need an AWS account. Create one by going to
[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) and clicking \"Sign Up.\"
You\'ll want to create a personal account. You will have to give it a
credit card number.

AWS Credit at SFU
-----------------

If you\'re an internal user at SFU and work with
`Computer-Architecture Lab` please see the SFU Arch Lab Wiki for
instructions on getting access to the AWS credit. Otherwise, continue
with the following section.

Requesting Limit Increases {#limitincrease}
--------------------------

In our experience, new AWS accounts do not have access to EC2 F1
instances by default. In order to get access, you should file a limit
increase request. You can learn more about EC2 instance limits here:
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-on-demand-instances.html#ec2-on-demand-instances-limits>

To request a limit increase, follow these steps:

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html>

You\'ll probably want to start out with the following request, depending
on your existing limits:

    Limit Type:                EC2 Instances
    Region:                    US East (Northern Virginia)
    Primary Instance Type:     All F instances
    Limit:                     Instance Limit
    New limit value:           64

This limit of 64 vCPUs for F instances allows you to run one node on the
`f1.2xlarge` or eight nodes on the `f1.16xlarge`.

For the \"Use Case Description\", you should describe your project and
write something about hardware simulation and mention that information
about the tool you\'re using can be found at:
<https://github.com/sfu-arch/muir>

This process has a human in the loop, so you should submit it ASAP. At
this point, you should wait for the response to this request.

If you\'re at Berkeley/UCB-BAR, you also need to wait until your account
has been added to the RISE billing pool, otherwise your personal CC will
be charged for AWS usage.

Hit Next below to continue.

Configuring Required Infrastructure in Your AWS Account
-------------------------------------------------------

Once we have an AWS Account setup, we need to perform some advance setup
of resources on AWS. You will need to follow these steps even if you
already had an AWS account as these are Dandelion-specific.

### Select a region

Head to the [EC2 Management
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home). In the top right
corner, ensure that the correct region is selected. You should select
one of: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `us-west-2` (Oregon), or `eu-west-1`
(Ireland), since F1 instances are only available in those regions.

Once you select a region, it\'s useful to bookmark the link to the EC2
console, so that you\'re always sent to the console for the correct
region.

### Key Setup

In order to enable automation, you will need to create a key named
`dandelion`, which we will use to launch all instances (Manager
Instance, Build Farm, Run Farm).

To do so, click \"Key Pairs\" under \"Network & Security\" in the
left-sidebar. Follow the prompts, name the key `aws-dandelion`, and save
the private key locally as `aws-dandelion.pem`. You can use this key to
access all instances from your local machine. We will copy this file to
our manager instance later, so that the manager can also use it.

### Check your EC2 Instance Limits

AWS limits access to particular instance types for new/infrequently used
accounts to protect their infrastructure. You should make sure that your
account has access to `f1.2xlarge`, `f1.4xlarge`, `f1.16xlarge`,
`m4.16xlarge`, and `c5.4xlarge` instances by looking at the \"Limits\"
page in the EC2 panel, which you can access
[here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Limits:). The values
listed on this page represent the maximum number of any of these
instances that you can run at once, which will limit the size of
simulations (\# of nodes) that you can run. If you need to increase your
limits, follow the instructions on the `limitincrease`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} page. To follow this guide, you need to be able to run one
`f1.2xlarge` instance and two `c5.4xlarge` instances.

### Start a t2.nano instance to test

Launch a `t2.nano` by following these instructions:

1.  Go to the [EC2 Management
    Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home) and click
    \"Launch Instance\"
2.  On the AMI selection page, select \"Amazon Linux AMI\...\", which
    should be the top option.
3.  On the Choose an Instance Type page, select `t2.nano`.
4.  Click \"Review and Launch\" (we don\'t need to change any other
    settings)
5.  On the review page, click \"Launch\"
6.  Select the `aws-dandelion` key pair we created previously, then
    click Launch Instances.
7.  Click on the instance name and note its public IP address.
8.  Waite for `instance State` to become `running`
9.  SSH into the `t2.nano` like so:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    ssh -i .ssh/aws-dandelion.pem ec2-user@54.158.143.95

Run the following to configure your aws account:

    aws configure
    [follow prompts]

See
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/tutorial-ec2-ubuntu.html#configure-cli-launch-ec2>
for more about aws configure. Within the prompt, you should specify the
same region that you chose above (one of `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`,
`eu-west-1`) and set the default output format to `json`. You will need
to generate an AWS access key in the \"Security Credentials\" menu of
your AWS settings (as instructed in
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys>
).

On the `t2.nano` instance, do the following:

    sudo yum -y install python-pip
    sudo pip install boto3
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amsharifian/dandelion-aws/master/scripts/aws-setup.py
    python aws-setup.py

This will create a VPC named `dandelion` and a security group named
`dandelion` in your account.

    Creating VPC for Dandelion...
    Success!
    Creating a subnet in the VPC for each availability zone...
    Success!
    Creating a security group for Dandelion...
    Success!

### Terminate the t2.nano

At this point, we are finished with the general account configuration.
You should terminate the t2.nano instance you created, since we do not
need it anymore (and it shouldn\'t contain any important data).

### Subscribe to the AWS FPGA Developer AMI {#ami-subscription}

Go to the [AWS Marketplace page for the FPGA Developer
AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ). Click the button
to subscribe to the FPGA Dev AMI (it should be free) and follow the
prompts to accept the EULA (but do not launch any instances).

Now, hit next to continue on to setting up our Manager Instance.

Launching a \"F1 Instance\"
---------------------------

Now, we need to launch a \"F1 Instance\" that we will `ssh` or `mosh`
into to work from. Since we will deploy the heavy lifting to separate
`c5.4xlarge` and `f1` instances later, the Manager Instance can be a
relatively cheap instance. In this guide, however, we will use a
`c5.4xlarge`, running the AWS FPGA Developer AMI. (Be sure to subscribe
to the AMI if you have not done so. See
`ami-subscription`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. Note that it might
take a few minutes after subscribing to the AMI to be able to launch
instances using it.)

Head to the [EC2 Management
Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home). In the top right
corner, ensure that the correct region is selected.

To launch a manager instance, follow these steps:

1.  From the main page of the EC2 Management Console, click
    `Launch Instance`. We use an on-demand instance here, so that your
    data is preserved when you stop/start the instance, and your data is
    not lost when pricing spikes on the spot market.
2.  When prompted to select an AMI, search in the `Community AMIs` tab
    for `FPGA Developer AMI - 1.7.0` and select the AMI that appears
    (there should be only one). **DO NOT USE ANY OTHER VERSION.**
3.  When prompted to choose an instance type, select the instance type
    of your choosing. A good choice is a `c5.4xlarge`.
4.  On the \"Configure Instance Details\" page:
    1.  First make sure that the `dandelion` VPC is selected in the
        drop-down box next to \"Network\". Any subnet within the
        `dandelion` VPC is fine.

    2.  Additionally, check the box for \"Protect against accidental
        termination.\" This adds a layer of protection to prevent your
        manager instance from being terminated by accident. You will
        need to disable this setting before being able to terminate the
        instance using usual methods.

    3.  Also on this page, expand \"Advanced Details\" and in the
        resulting text box, paste the following:

        ``` {.bash}
        ```

        This will pre-install all of the dependencies needed to run
        Dandelion on your instance.
5.  On the next page (\"Add Storage\"), increase the size of the root
    EBS volume to \~300GB. The default of 65GB can quickly become too
    small as you accumulate large Vivado reports/outputs, large
    waveforms, XSim outputs, and large root filesystems for simulations.
    You should get rid of the small (5GB) secondary volume that is added
    by default.
6.  You can skip the \"Add Tags\" page, unless you want tags.
7.  On the \"Configure Security Group\" page, select the `firesim`
    security group that was automatically created for you earlier.
8.  On the review page, click the button to launch your instance.

Make sure you select the `dandelion` key pair that we setup earlier.

### Access your instance

We recommend using [mosh](https://mosh.org/) instead of `ssh` or using
`ssh` with a screen/tmux session running on your manager instance to
ensure that long-running jobs are not killed by a bad network connection
to your manager instance. On this instance, the `mosh` server is
installed as part of the setup script we pasted before, so we need to
first ssh into the instance and make sure the setup is complete.

In either case, `ssh` into your instance (e.g.
`ssh -i aws-dandelion.pem centos@YOUR_INSTANCE_IP`) and wait until the
`~/machine-launchstatus` file contains all the following text:

    centos@ip-172-30-2-140.us-west-2.compute.internal:~$ cat machine-launchstatus
    machine launch script started
    machine launch script completed!

Once this line appears, exit and re-`ssh` into the system. If you want
to use `mosh`, `mosh` back into the system.

Now we are ready to start developing our custom logic designs on AWS F1
instances!

GUI FPGA Development Environment with NICE DCV
==============================================

This guide shows steps to setup a GUI FPGA Development Environment using
the FPGA Developer AMI using NICE DCV

Overview
--------

[NICE
DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html)
can be used create a virtual desktop on your FPGA Developer AMI
instance.

[NICE
DCV](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html)
is a high-performance remote display protocol that provides customers
with a secure way to deliver remote desktops and application streaming
from any cloud or data center to any device, over varying network
conditions.

With NICE DCV and Amazon EC2, customers can run graphics-intensive
applications remotely on EC2 instances and stream the results to simpler
client machines, eliminating the need for expensive dedicated
workstations. Customers across a broad range of HPC workloads use NICE
DCV for their remote visualization requirements. The NICE DCV streaming
protocol is also utilized by popular services like Amazon AppStream 2.0
and AWS RoboMaker.

The [DCV Administrator
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html)
and the [User
guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
are the official resources on how to configure and use DCV.

The installation process is summarized below for your convenience.

**NOTE**: These steps may change when new versions of the DCV Server and
Clients are released. If you experience issues please refer to the
[Official DCV
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/what-is-dcv.html)).

Installation Process
--------------------

1.  [Setup your FPGA Developer AMI Instance with an IAM
    Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/setting-up-license.html#setting-up-license-ec2)
    that grants your instance access to NICE DCV endpoints.

    > NICE DCV is available for free to use on EC2.
    >
    > The NICE DCV server automatically detects that it is running on an
    > Amazon EC2 instance and periodically connects to an Amazon S3
    > bucket to determine whether a valid license is available. The IAM
    > role enables this functionality.
    >
    > Please follow the steps mentioned in the above guide to attach an
    > IAM role to your instance with the following policy:

``` {.json}
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dcv-license.region/*"
      }
   ]
}

 **NOTE:** Without access to the DCV bucket mentioned in the [NICE DCV licensing setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/adminguide/setting-up-license.html#setting-up-license-ec2), your server license is only valid of 15 days.
```

2.  On your FPGA Developer AMI Instance [update the Instance Security
    Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#adding-security-group-rule)
    to allow TCP Port **8443** Ingress
